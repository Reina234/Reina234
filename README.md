## Hi there, I'm Reina ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year MEng student at the University of Cambridge, specialising in scientific machine learning, control systems, and data-driven modelling of physical and biological systems.

Much of the code here comes from university research and coursework completed under tight deadlines, often while I was rapidly developing my software skills. These projects leaned more toward quick prototyping than clean structure (but there was a plenty of learning along the way!).

Iâ€™m now working on new projects with a more polished approach, and Iâ€™ll be updating this profile with those soon.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to reach out!
